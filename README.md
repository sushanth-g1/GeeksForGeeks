# DSA Foundation 🚀

This repository contains foundational Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in Java.

Topics Covered:
- Euclidean GCD (Iterative and Recursive)
- Array Utilities: Reverse, Second Max, Missing Number
- Stock Buy & Sell (Single and Multiple Transactions)

More topics coming soon: Arrays, Recursion, Trees, etc.

## 📌 Week 3 Progress Update
This week I covered the following topics:

- 🔁 **Recursion** – basics, subsequences, subsets, power set
- 🔙 **Backtracking** – Rat in a Maze, Word Search, Permutations, N-Queens intro
- 🎯 **Two Pointers** – classic problems like Two Sum, Move Zeroes, Pair sum in sorted array
- 📏 **Sliding Window** – fixed and variable window techniques

### 🚀 Key Learnings:
- Building recursive intuition step by step (base case + choice diagram).
- Backtracking as "explore → undo → explore" (e.g., subsets & permutations).
- Two pointers to reduce nested loops efficiently.
- Sliding window for substring/array range-based problems.
